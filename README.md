## Description

This application is a simple text-editor using webpack. The text editor has an isntillation feature that allows you to download the app locally to your computer.

<br>

## Learning Points

- 'Concurrently' NPM Scripts
- Webpack servers
- Webpack configuration with Plugins and Modules
- Installing applications through the browser.

<br>

## Features

This project creates a text-editor application using Heroku. The application was built with webpack, which creates a leaner application for deployment. The browser version of the application allows you to install a local application for the text-editor. This is useful during development by having a separate window for writing code, outside of your development environment.
